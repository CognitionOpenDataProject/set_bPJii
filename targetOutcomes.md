For this article you should focus on the findings reported in section 3. Results. Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> 3.1. Pupil diameter

> We observed a main effect of Emotion [F(1, 19) = 6.45, MSE = .0039, p = .02, η2 = .25], revealing a larger pupil diameter for happy compared to fearful facial expressions irrespective of presentation condition (Figs. 2A and 3). There was no main effect of Presentation Condition [F(1, 19) = 0.40, MSE = .0029, p = .53, η2 = .02] and no interaction between Presentation Condition and Emotion [F(1, 19) = 1.17, MSE = .0011, p = .29, η2 = .06].

> A control analysis excluding items from one actress displaying no teeth in the fearful condition (see Methods) and three participants yielded a similar pattern of results, although the main effect of emotion is only marginally significant in this case [F(1, 16) = 3.845, p = 0.068, η2 = .19]. The marginal effect is likely explained by reduced power because we had to exclude three additional infants from this analysis (n = 17 instead of n = 20 in the main analysis) in order to adhere to our inclusion criterion.

> 3.2. Fixation duration

> While the main focus of the study was clearly on the analysis of pupil size, we also compared differences in fixation duration to complement this analysis.

> As for pupil size, we observed a main effect of Emotion; infants showed a significantly longer fixation duration for happy compared to fearful facial expressions [F(1, 21) = 4.57, MSE = 0.015, p = .044, η2 = .19]. Furthermore, we found a main effect of Presentation Condition, showing that infants looked longer in the subliminal compared to the supraliminal condition [F(1, 21) = 8.57, MSE = 0.020, p = .008, η2 = .29] (see Fig. 2B). Note that in the subliminal conditions, a neutral face was presented during the time used for analyzing the fixation duration; hence, this effect can also be framed as a longer looking duration to neutral faces (as compared to emotional faces) preceded by subliminal emotional ones. An interaction between Presentation Condition and AOI [F(1, 21) = 20.42, MSE = 0.010, p < .001, η2 = .49] revealed that this was the case in particular for the eye region [t(21) = −4.06, p < .001, r = .66].

> Furthermore, we observed a main effect of AOI [F(1, 21) = 59.05, MSE = 0.073, p < .001, η2 = .74], showing that infants fixated longer on the eye than on the mouth AOI.

> There was no significant interaction between Emotion and Presentation Condition [F(1, 21) = 0.09, MSE = 0.007, p = .77, η2 = .004], AOI and Emotion [F(1, 21) = 0.004, MSE = 0.008, p = .95, η2 = .0002], or Emotion, Presentation Condition, and AOI [F(1, 21) = 1.76, MSE = 006, p = .20, η2 = .077].

> 3.3. Results of correlation analysis

> We did not observe a significant correlation between pupil diameter and fixation duration for the sum of both AOIs (p = .51, r = −.18), for the eye AOI (p = .31, r = −.27), or for the mouth AOI (p = .55, r = .16).
